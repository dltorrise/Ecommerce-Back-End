  ## Description
  
  An back-end application using Sequelize--an ORM tool, Express, and SQL to manage product database information. It also utilyzes the .env module to protect sensitive information.

  ## General Information
  
  ### Installation
  
  To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  
  ```npm i ```

  ### Usage 

  This application uses Express, mysql2, sequelize, and .env as dependencies. Because they are in the package.json file, no additional action is necessary to download these dependencies. 
  
  **Important Note**: In the config file, you might need to change the host. It is currently "127.0.0.1" because that is what works for my machine. Some machines might only work if you type "localhost."
